# Pacman Solver

This project is a Python-based implementation of a Pacman solver. It uses various search algorithms to solve a Pacman game represented as a 2D grid.

## Files in the Project

- `ex1.py`: This file contains the main logic for the Pacman game. It includes the definition of the Pacman problem, the game state, and the actions that can be performed in the game.

- `ex1_test.py`: This file contains the unit tests for the Pacman solver. It tests various cases to ensure the solver is working as expected.

- `ex1_check.py`: This file contains the function to run the Pacman problem and check the solution. It also includes the definition of different problems and their expected solutions.

- `utils.py`: This file contains various utility functions used across the project.

## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the main file using the command `python ex1.py`.
5. To run the tests, use the command `python ex1_test.py`.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries:

- `unittest`: For running the unit tests.
- `math`: For mathematical operations.
- `random`: For generating random numbers.
- `copy`: For creating copies of data structures.
- `sys`: For system-specific parameters and functions.
- `os.path`: For using operating system dependent functionality.
- `bisect`: For array bisection algorithm.
- `inspect`: For getting live information about objects such as modules, classes, methods, etc.
